                        I am a detail orientated and deadline-driven undergrad, who is open to the different opportunities that are out there for me to dive into. The future of this economy will rely on technology and big data. New technology has always been something that I was interested in, especially new tech gadgets such as the safety features in a car or the newest iPhone or even the new EV tech. Since I am in the front end of receiving the products, I would like to see the planning process in the back-end and some of the development processes.

                        My career goal is to work for a big tech company and travel the world for work. I want to be able to work while spending time in different cities. It may be a long time before I achieve the goal that I have set for myself but it is a goal that I am keeping in sight. </p>
