                <h2>Current Undergrad at Drexel University</h2>
                <p>
                    Currently a 4th year pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Business Administration with majors in Business Analytics and Management Information Systems at Drexel University. I also minor in the Chinese Language, which I went to Tsinghua University to complete for 4 months. My second minor being Interactive Digital Media. I am hoping to step into the UX/UI field with business background and language background.
                <br>
                    I am a detail orientated and deadline-driven undergrad, who is open to the different opportunities that are out there for me to dive into. The future of this economy will rely on technology and big data. New technology has always been something that I was interested in, especially new tech gadgets such as the safety features in a car or the newest iPhone or even the new EV tech. Since I am in the front end of receiving the products, I would like to see the planning process in the back-end and some of the development processes.
                <br>
                    Becoming a leader for the next generation, especially as a first-generation, low-income student. Reaching for the opportunities that my parents never got the chance to reach for. My parents never completed middle school as they didn't have the funds to and moving to America was the better choice for more opportunties. I want to give back to my parents and show them that all their sacrifices are worth it. All the hours they put into working in the restaurant is finally getting a payback. 
                <br>
                    My career goal is to work for a big tech company and travel the world for work. I want to be able to work while spending time in different cities. It may be a long time before I achieve the goal that I have set for myself but it is a goal that I am keeping in sight.
